# Clustering-on-Mall-Customers-Data

The purpose of this work is to do clustering of customers to understand the customers and identify the right number of clusters based on the patterns generated from the customers dataset. Then, create a dependent variable which will take a finite number of values equal to the number of clusters.

Apply K-means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering to get the optimal number of clusters.

Data description :- A mall collected some data about their customers which includes the customer I.D., the gender, the age, the annual income and the spending score. The Spending Score signifies how much each customer spends in the mall and can take values between 1 and 100, where 1 means the customer spends less and 100 means the customer spends high. Each row in the dataset corresponds to a customer of the mall. It contains almost 200 observations with 3 numerical features and 1 categorical feature and has no missing data.

Steps:- 1. Importing the libraries 2. Importing the dataset 3. Finding optimal number of clusters 4. Training the Clustering models on the Dataset 5. Visualizing the Clusters.

Conclusion:- Both K-means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering gives 5 clusters for this dataset. Thus, classifying the mall customers into 5 types.
